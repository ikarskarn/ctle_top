                        <p> Most students - including many who are brand new to Central Piedmont - will experience their semester fully online, from wherever they are. The lines between formal study, personal/work, and home responsibilities and commitments will be blurred for our students and for us. We need to consider these pressures and circumstances when adapting to our new standards of excellence.</p>

                        <p>For those of us who had to adapt to online instruction without preparation, it has illuminated the gaps in which we can connect with our students to meet their needs. As we begin the return to campus, Traditional (TR) courses will no longer be standard; instead, the teaching modalities of courses are Hybrid (HY), Online (IN), and Blended (BL) have been introduced enabling synchronous learning with students who come to class and those connecting remotely.</p>

                        <p>As many may have realized, the way we engage students online can present its own set of challenges and it is critical to find ways to continually connect and interact with students. Relying solely on synchronous lectures and the learning management system is not the ideal solution to meet our studentsâ€™ needs. </p>

                        <p>This Teaching Roadmap will offer you, Central Piedmont faculty, suggestions on alternative teaching approaches that you can use, or even be inspired from, to keep your students engaged in the learning process.  </p>
